Shaun Fisher,checked,"Shaun Fisher emphasizes the need for First Nations oyster farmers to challenge existing narratives, secure leases for economic growth, and create generational wealth while advocating for a collective approach and establishing a First Nations Oyster Growers Association for better support and funding opportunities., Shaun Fisher recounts how his community on North Stradbroke Island reclaims and sustains their land and waters through self-built homes and oyster farming. He describes growing up in Brisbane, eventually returning to the island as a teenager and finding deeper roots in One Mile, an off-grid settlement where families build solar-powered houses, collect rainwater, and rely on each other’s expertise. Oysters hold cultural and economic significance, so Shaun—alongside relatives and mentors—has established commercial leases to harvest them while preserving traditional practices like tripod structures and wild spat catching. Despite barriers such as lack of insurance, limited government support, and regulatory hurdles, the community presses on, seeing oyster farming as both a cultural inheritance and a lucrative business model that can empower future generations. Shaun emphasizes cooperation among kin, local governance by elders, and a determination to provide long-term stability for his children. Overall, he envisions a self-sufficient, culturally grounded economy where his people stand on their own terms and invite outside collaboration only when it aligns with their collective well-being.

To be taken seriously as an oyster farmer or commercial operator nowadays, you can't stay stagnant—you have to put yourself in a position where they can't question your standing. It doesn't change who I am as a person; to them, I've just got a title now and they see me as a commercial Black face they can tick off their box. But don't forget about the rest of the bay. We might have an agreement to farm these two areas with their support and funding, but we're going to take back the whole bay. We're not going to stop there—we're going to take it all, and they're going to support us. That's how I see this project developing over the next 10–20 years.
With that position as a commercial operator, and with the support of my elders and people like Ben, we're leading these initiatives not just for Fisher's Oysters, but for the next generation of the whole community. I don't think any other First Nations farmers have been operating with that mindset or approach of really challenging what these fellows are trying to dictate.
Hopefully, we can tap into the existing energy—if you think about the elders as a whole and the progress they want to see happen, everyone's lifting each other up. If we can own that narrative, it's such a powerful case study. I'm on the board of the Food Connect Shed, and they've got a Food Connect Foundation with a big Olympics push around farm-to-plate, aiming for 100%. That's following the same approach. The opportunity is there, and the timing is ideal.
The challenge is making sure we're owning the narrative and those spaces where they're talking. They've got this massive Olympic committee with people coming through, but they can't even decide where to put a stadium—they're so far from having these conversations the right way. But I think we can get ahead of the game with the narrative. That's where we're setting the foundation right for our young ones. Everything will be laid out for them. They just need to show up and won't have to feel the pressure we've had to deal with. The barriers for our mob to get a lease are tough because we can't compete, but I think the community approach will really start to show some big things.
How many leases are available now on the island? Well, it's not like they've got them listed on Facebook Marketplace or anything—it's quite a process. It's not up to you; it depends on how much money you've got. These farmers can see they're starting to capitalize off the bay. A lease out here that my mate bought for $3,000 is now going for $20,000. That's just for a bare lease—if it's fully operational at commercial scale, it could be up to $100,000.
They're not looking at growing capacity; they're just looking at profit. I know farmers here who have bought farms but are only working one. One guy in particular—he's a friend of mine—purchased all the banks up in Bribie, one down in Pimpama, and about four in Moreton. I think there's about six up in Bribie, four up here in Moreton, and another one down there—like ten leases, but he's only working one or two. They're packaging all these things up to go to the highest bidder—it's like land banking.
That's what these fellows have been doing for quite some time. I was able to secure a few cheaper ones before prices went up too much. I got two really good leases to build momentum. It's about trying to snap up those deals before they get out of reach. This is about building up our own economic health and support. For me and my family, it's about getting into a position where we can create generational wealth and not feel like we're getting hunted off these oyster leases. That's how it was for us growing up—we'd go out on these oyster leases and get chased off them. I was chased off one the other day, pretty much. My neighbor, an oyster farmer, said, ""You just stay on your lease and I'll stay on mine."" That shows how embedded this mindset is with these people—they're so stuck in their ways.
We're trying to move forward together—there are some good people who want to work together. They've got the Queensland Oyster Growers Association, and then Australia's got their own association as well. Ben and I have been talking about a First Nations Oyster Growers Association for the whole state. It would be awesome to have Richard involved in that kind of initiative. We're advocating for mob and creating these pathways, understanding the system well, and challenging it effectively to achieve our outcomes.
When you've got those associations, you can start pushing for funding. Without those structures, you miss opportunities. It's like Brody up in Mount Isa who runs Camping on Country and gyms—he's got everything needed to succeed but doesn't have a governance board or big organization, while all the established organizations there just get funding and buy cars. He's doing the actual work but struggling for support. We've started getting him some backing, but it's frustrating that you need these Western frameworks when the community structure is already there with elder support.
That's similar to our situation, but our elders have their not-for-profit company with DGR status, which means they can access bigger funding packages. For us, we could just operate Fisher's Oysters comfortably as a Black business, but it's far bigger than that—it's about the work I want to contribute to and knowing when to bring modern approaches., Shaun Full Interview
===

[00:00:00] 

Shaun Fisher: Just very grateful for it, eh? So. 

Benjamin Knight: What's um, how big are the salvos on the island? Like, how much work do they do? 

Shaun Fisher: Oh, they don't do nothing over here. Oh, really? Nah. Nah, they do nothing. So. Well, not that I know of. Like, yeah. Apart from, yeah, not too much really. 

Benjamin Knight: So what are we, what are we doing today? 

Shaun Fisher: So we're heading up to go get the boat from up one mile, which is where we live.

And um, 

Milton: Yeah, 

Shaun Fisher: we'll get up and uh, load the boat up or we loaded the boat this morning. So we'll just hook the boat up and we'll go launch it. Get out. And, uh, put some tripods up. With, um, With the community, so. Part of the school holiday program. [00:01:00] Get out and do Where's, 

Benjamin Knight: what's the location of the lease? Has it got a name and sort of 

Shaun Fisher: Yeah.

Yeah, so Danbilla. Bay is where we'll be putting the tripods up. And that's up in, uh, Down the south of Dunwich, so. Um, A lot of People can walk there, so I feel the kids will just sort of catch up down at the beach and walk down on the low tide, so that'll make it a lot easier for us and transport and stuff like that, so.

What's the 

Benjamin Knight: like, um, is there a specific like oyster history in the island type of thing, like is there a meaning to it or is it more like, um, yeah, have there been ebbs and flows as to what oysters mean on the island? 

Shaun Fisher: Yeah, I think oysters have always been a part of who [00:02:00] we are. It's one of our main food sources and I think it's just something that you almost take for granted, eh?

Because like, we um, oh we got, we just got a bitumen roadie yesterday so I've got to put my indicator up in the bush. But, um. Yeah, oysters have always been a part of what we've always done over here on the island. And I think, yeah, we've just always been a bit spoiled in that sense. But yeah, I think it's again, just practicing that in a different form where we're sort of, um, heading along the commercial line, but still today I guess is maintaining those, um, cultural practices.

So that's what we're doing today with the tripods. This is, um, continuing that for these young ones to, to practice. And as you can see, [00:03:00] like where we are here, um, we've got a few different types of dune pine. Your sheoaks and your cypress, which are the timbers that we are using today. So we're using three different types of timbers.

And a part of that would be to see what species, um, grow on them in a bit more. Hey. 

Milton: Um, 

Shaun Fisher: yeah, so, yeah, just being able to continue practicing is, um, one of the biggest things, driving factors for us. And, um, while, you know, we, we look here and then there's all these oyster bags where that's, you know, the commercial side of it.

Being able to,[00:04:00] 

you know, adapt to those ways, but as well as continuing our connection. Yeah. So, I guess that for us is, yeah, there's ebbs and flows, like you said, um, it has. It's always fluctuated over time, I think, just be careful there, I'm going to reverse it, so, this is um, my spotter, 

Milton: so

Benjamin Knight: we're going to put the boat up and, 

Speaker 5: yeah we'll hit, hit the road.[00:05:00] 

Shaun Fisher: So, yeah, just sort of a new lot of housing. 

Benjamin Knight: So is this like the real Australia? Like the people's Australia? And then there's the tourism Australia? This is 

Shaun Fisher: it. Yeah, this is, this is, this is Stradbroke. 

Benjamin Knight: Yeah. 

Shaun Fisher: Yeah, this is who we are. And I guess growing up as a young fella like these fellas, I'd always come to One Mile, but One Mile was very small down along the creek when we were younger.

And, um It was,

yeah, a lot smaller then. It was a lot tougher for them ones, I think, as well. They did it really tough with, um, like, a lot of their water would come from the creeks. Um, I'm going to have to watch out, son.

So, like, we're pretty spoilt when it comes [00:06:00] to living in the bush. We've got solar panels. We're on, off the grid totally, so. Rainwater tanks are full from all the rain. Um, yeah, the whole house is self sufficient, so. I think, um, I'm very blessed to have this place. And, um, I'm just going to have to fix this back up, so.

Hey Tel, can you close this door, please?[00:07:00] 

How far?

Benjamin Knight: What's the feeling with, like, ownership?

Shaun Fisher: I think ownership for us has always been what we know. So as a young fella, again, like coming up here, the houses were, I remember working on one of my great uncles, grandfathers, uncle Dennis's place as a young fella. And like, we sort of come in on the last of it, me and my, one of my brothers, cousins, and we got to build the well.

Tower and [00:08:00] um, just how proud he was, you know, like getting to that point of having a whale tower. But again, like I remember coming out and seeing the old drop toilets and um, then I've seen the septics come in and, and then, um, yeah, flushing toilets power and how much those little things that you take for granted really, um, Made a big difference to them and so like it was them that set that precedent for us Now you've got to have running water.

Now, you've got to have electricity and You know that stability was what [00:09:00] we strive for here for our people So then as you can see like we built this house, I think in 2017 we started this place and it started off as

Yeah, it was It's just a bare block, but we just, again, being here in one mile, we were building one of my cousin's, um, um, house. And um, I think we were doing a bit on my uncle's place as well, just over there. And it was those seeds that were planted from them ones that continued to water it. And yeah, now it's just multiplied.

And as you can see, that's all other houses that are, and then I guess, um, That self [00:10:00] determination, eh, to have, have, um, stability and take back what was ours. So yeah, we just repossessed the land. We just took it back and started building our houses, building our foundations strong so they didn't fall down and continue on that for the next generation.

Do you 

Benjamin Knight: feel any like, um, effect or feedback from like general folk around how, how this sort of went about on this part of land? Oh lord, the people haven't. Like, do people talk to you about it? Do they like Yeah, yeah, yeah, most 

Shaun Fisher: A lot of the residents, Stradbroke Island residents, are really supportive. A lot of, um, community.

But a lot of them don't understand either. A lot of them go, oh, youse can, youse can do that type of stuff. And youse can [00:11:00] take, you know, build that. But, reality is, we can't get insurance for our houses. So, I think Dunwich is like one of the most fire prone places, um, in, well around here anyways. So, like, some of the big fires that come through here have, um, definitely put the wind up ya as a, as a homeowner, and to be denied to insure your property that's, you know, over half a mil, probably worse.

Close to a mil now, if you put it in those terms of, um, 

Benjamin Knight: but The thing I don't think about is, the shocking thing is, disparity between people from Brisbane who come here on holidays and have holiday [00:12:00] homes and rent one out and 

Shaun Fisher: Yep 

Benjamin Knight: The reality 

Speaker 7: for the people that might have been here forever, right? Yep 

Shaun Fisher: And that's it, like I think, I know people that go We've got a holiday house up in Rainbow Crescent, which is, what's your head son, um, a part of the Dunwich Township, which is only 500 metres up the road.

Pretty much this track along the back would be the extension of Rainbow Crescent, so it would be equivalent to those houses that sit up on that hill. Um, so one thing I can say is that They've put a, there's a fire hydrant over here that they only just put in like probably a few months ago. What's your head?

[00:13:00] Which, I did a lot of firefighting, um, fire management and stuff over here and You know, just to have that sense of security to go, you know, if a fire does come through we can sort of tap into that. But we wasn't relying on that type of stuff, you know, we had fire hose, fire hydrants and, I mean, fire, um, pumps and stuff like that, as you can see over here.

That was again to ensure that we didn't have to be left sort of, um, a bit stuck. So, yeah, I think, um, it's just again fighting for our rights, hey, as Aboriginal [00:14:00] people. And how do we challenge that and how do we go forward? I think, that's what I love about One Mile is because you can continue just challenging that against these systems that have, you know, kept us down.

Speaker 7: How much is it about people coming together and supporting each other to hear, you know what I mean? Versus, I think like, there's so many strategic ways you can approach things by making relationships with government or philanthropy or like, people have money. But how much do you think is just the people here coming together to support each other?

Speaker 5: It's 

Shaun Fisher: powerful. It's pretty powerful. I think what we're doing here is a precedent for a lot of communities. So again, it's taking back what's ours and not waiting for government, not waiting for them to go, Hey, look, we've got this, but you've got to divvy it up and do all this [00:15:00] shit. Excuse my language. And we're just going, you know what, like, come up here and I'll show you this, um,

You know, part of it, like when we started this project, we built these foundations again, quite strong these for COVID. So my uncle, uncle Dale took me on as a, um, laborer, young chippy and, um, gave me the skills that I needed to, to build this. And so when we started building this, um, me and my family and all my cousins and my uncles.

It was, um, that empowerment that, again, we can sort of [00:16:00] determine our own outcomes and together we can achieve these things. And so I look at this project as one of the first projects that I was able to be a part of and build for my family and sort of, again, contribute in my generation to, um, So when we built this house originally, we were building, um,

these, um, rafters outta uh, out of, uh, Cyprus, but we ended up blowing up the chainsaw, and um, we only got this one beam and we milled that out of a Cyprus that was just burnt from one of the, um,

one of the trees around one mile. [00:17:00] So originally, yeah, we were supposed to do all these and expose all those rafters like that. This is Davey Hey, this is my younger fella. Hey Davey So yeah, we, we, um, all the bits and pieces like the kitchen we got from Amity. I think we paid like 400 bucks All the timber on the back brander, I got it from a house out point lookout that they were demolishing Um, all the windows just come from everywhere.

I think I was getting on like eBay, I think I paid no more than 50 bucks for all of our windows. Um, this is when the kids protested the jetty. To save the jetty. So my son and a few of the kids led that. And they saved the jetty. That was the picture that This is [00:18:00] when we, um, this is where the house is now.

So,

it's, uh, this is Kyan, my wife. 

Speaker 7: Sorry, I'm making a little documentary there. 

Shaun Fisher: No, you're fine. Um, and then, yeah, we sort of built this little project I've got going on here. I'm gonna make some boomerangs. Adom. Yeah, this is home. This is one more. This is a place where we come to rest. I think for me, again, it was um, just setting that place up.

Because I grew up in Brisbane. And it wasn't until I got to my teens that I was able to come back home here. And [00:19:00] really find myself really grounded. And just find who I was as a young fella. And then to set up this space for my children, so. Yeah, this is it. 

Benjamin Knight: What's the, like at a high level, what's the set up with who owns the land at the moment?

Like, is there any, is there any like formal? 

Shaun Fisher: Nah, I think, I think um, I'm not too sure what goes on there with um, we just, yeah, I don't even acknowledge it in some part. I'll show you down here, the solar. But I guess, I remember when I worked as a ranger, we'd come up here to do a survey on, on the houses.

And, Department of, I think it was DNR, Department of Natural Resources. There was some sort of tenure there, over that. But this is how, how the house runs. 

Speaker 8: It 

Shaun Fisher: runs off these [00:20:00] batteries. So, four batteries run the whole household. And, sometimes we have to kick the jenny in, but the jenny's not good. It's, it's broken.

But, Yeah, we run off septic. So just like every other 

Milton: township. 

Shaun Fisher: Yeah. Yeah. We, um, just run off septic and that's where that's our sewage.

Yeah.

So yeah, I think, um, just to watch that growth in where we want to head for our people in that unity of coming together and sticking together for that. [00:21:00] I, I, I see it as the same concept as the oystering. So for me with oystering, you know, there's a big, big business there to be tapped into. And I, you know, I think again, it's getting our people into a position where they can lead that and then they can fully take charge.

And, um, yeah, any sort of projects going forward for us is, you know, it's going to be setting these next ones up. So there. Creating that. 

Benjamin Knight: How do you feel like, um, I've been super impressed with the way in 

Speaker 7: which the strategy, like I've been talking about, you started a partnership. What's that, what's that mean to you in terms of if someone has a way to support this as a whole?

What's, what's a partnership look and feel like for you? Especially with people that are not from, from here? [00:22:00] 

Shaun Fisher: I guess support. And understanding of where it is that we want to go. Um, so I think, to yeah, to just sort of support First Nations grassroots. And what does that look like? It might, like, look like what people think it looks like.

And so, I think a lot of people, especially Australia, have a hard time understanding that. Until you come here and see it, you go, shit, this is pretty, pretty big. This is, you know, again, like, the, I've just went and cleared and started building our oyster um, area for our land base. And again, we're not sitting here waiting for these ones, we're just doing it.

We're just taking back what's ours. Because again, government's sitting there going, Oh, [00:23:00] you know, there's Quandamooka marine aspirations. You know, and you've got to, nah, we're just doing it. We're just taking it back. If we want to be oyster farmers, commercial operators, and again, it's challenging them in a way that it's not just us fish as oysters that are going forward, it's us as a community going forward.

So again, being able to do it in a way that there's unity and not just operating as a family business as individuals. We're operating on a community level and we're coming to level up and start to, you know, have, have our own table. And if they want to sit at our table, we choose to invite them. And that's the thing, they've got their own table and we're not even invited.

And that's how this industry is operating, and it has been for quite some time since they've come here. So that, [00:24:00] back to the oystering. That sort of started off, I don't know, when they first come. And it was more so extraction. So I think 95 percent of the bale, something ridiculous, of extraction, so, they just took away the oysters.

They didn't, um, I guess, yeah, catch them and, to some degree I think there was stick farming and, You know, that sort of come in the 80s, I think, and a lot of those were like, um, not so much the 80s, but the bags and that all sort of started to come around that time. And then, I think now it's just, yeah, legislations, all those things that push a lot of our mob out.

That restricted us from staying in the industry. So a lot of our people had to sell up and get out of it. So, a lot of restrictions for our people. Is [00:25:00] there 

Benjamin Knight: like a, um, Connection between this idea of governance and legislation, you know what I mean? Like, do you think that 

Speaker 7: you have your own governance on the island that would support all the other shit that legislation stuff is supposed to do with government?

Like, 

Shaun Fisher: do you 

Speaker 7: your own governance and you'll get to do 

Shaun Fisher: that? Yeah, most definitely. Like, for, for me, I go straight to my elders, so that's my governance. Um, any discussions, I'll speak directly to my grandfather. And then from that, I'll speak to my uncles and great. And just, yeah, again, that open communication, who, who sort of, who's the expert in those areas as well.

So if it's housing, it's oyster farming, if it's language, all those things, you sort of know who's the spokesperson for that. [00:26:00] And who holds that, who's the knowledge holder. Um, and so being able to follow those protocols as well. Especially for me as a young fellow, I've got a lot of aspirations. A lot of, and I've got to sort of ground myself.

So they really ground me in what? As much as I've, you know, try and Yeah, really, um, those are the governance. And those are the ones that steer that for me. 

Benjamin Knight: There's so much teaching out there that needs to be done for people that have their own way of doing things. Yep. 

Milton: Yep. 

Shaun Fisher: And that's it, so Um, Do you want to come up and suss out the rest of the house?

Let's go. Let's go.

So this is our [00:27:00] solar. Runs off an inverter. Well, yeah, it's all that. Um, usually do our washing during the day. But, as you can see, like, again, we're pretty spoiled. That fan runs all the time. Got to build myself an ensuite. So, again, like, just This was out of some Cypress that come, I think I got this for like 10, 20 bucks from Gumtree.

Um, it's again just, yeah.

These are some old French oars, I swapped these for, um, some fishing rods of Gumtree. So, oh, but yeah, eventually I'll get to the veranda. Uh, yeah. [00:28:00] We sort of started off with just the kitchen and that was um, yeah, little toilet in the backyard and showering the kids out with the hose out the window. When I got this I got, made sure I made sure I got a bath that I could fit in, but you can only use that when the, when it's raining.

When it's overflowing. So. But yeah. These are the kids rooms. These are my older boys but, a bit messy these fellas. We got to do this art like, that was a really cool project we got to do with one of my brothers. He got to, yeah. It was um, the twins, these are my twins room. And um, yeah just to give them [00:29:00] that.

Now that's mum. It's mum. It's my girl's room, Kyla. She's the only one that's got her own room. So yeah, that's, that's, that's, yeah. It's one mile in. There's plenty more of these places around, you know, like I think. Yeah, it was just definitely. Alright, boys, let's go.

I'll catch you's up. See you, Davi. 

Speaker 4: See ya, Davy. See ya, Mom. See ya, Davy. See ya. Where's your shirt, Bridget? In the car.

Benjamin Knight: Where did Dale learn how to 

Shaun Fisher: build? 

Benjamin Knight: He built up 

Shaun Fisher: here. [00:30:00] That's his house. Beautiful, this house. 

Benjamin Knight: Um, where did he get the skills for building 

Shaun Fisher: stuff? He's a carpenter. Um, he learnt as a young fella and that's when he come back and taught me. son and, um, a few others, cousins. And, you know, I think, um, as a young fella, we were very blessed to have that role model.

And, you know, a lot of the things, if it wasn't for those people in our lives at that time, I remember I was just a young fella walking along Dunwich and Uncle Dale pulls up and I was, you know, a bit, um, Bit walking around a bit lost and, um, he goes, Hey, do you want some work? And I said, yeah, no worries.

And, uh, see ya brother. [00:31:00] Flat out mate. Uh, and, um,

Yeah, he said, you want to come hold some ceiling sheets for me? And it was there, then I

found an interest into timber and carpentry. And I was able to get the skills on the tools and, uh, really helped shape

that for me as a, Aboriginal man, I, you know, from having that role model that taught me. Taught me how to, um, be a provider for my family and sort of, again, that self determination of, you know, he ran his own business, he wasn't sitting there [00:32:00] waiting, um, so that true, um, determination to bring that change.

And that's sort of, with the oystering as well, I've sort of, you know, taken that concept up. What does that look like for me as a business owner? As a, um, so, I'm not dictated by, you know, these

programs that sort of set us up to fail.

And that's where I want to see, you know, the next generation. There's a lot of oyster farms out here, a lot of leases that aren't being worked. They got to come back to the people, you know? Either that or we just start taking them. Which we are, we will. And it's again, to have that position in the industry.

To have, to be taken serious, you know?[00:33:00] 

And, to do it in a way where

We're not staying stagnant. We're, we're, we're just continuing to build and build and build on these young ones, build them up, giving them the support they need to take that on.

Here's them young followers there.

Which is [00:34:00] a different area for growing, so get different results, a lot cleaner waters, um, a bit more open waters as well, so. Um, a little bit different for growing. So you sort of grow your biggest stuff up here, whereas the one down here south of Dunwich where we're going today to do the work more ideal for a nursery.

So you're smaller stuff. Um, and so it's sort of important when we're working the bay to have different um, different locations for growing for different outcomes.

Hold on.

This is our [00:35:00] northern lease.

Tide looks like it might be um,

what's that son? 

Milton: Hey? 

Shaun Fisher: Nah, of course, we've got to get going.

Jump off the top. So this has got a little gutter in here. The kids love to swim in here when we get out here and you get to, to see some, jump up there if you want.

So this is our northern lease. It's um, north of Dunwich. And so this lease is in a bit more [00:36:00] open waters. As you can see we're not. That's a big ray there. Um.

There's a few mob. Down from, uh, I think Yarrabah. And they've asked to come out and catch some turtles for the Invasion Day Rally. 

Benjamin Knight: How about Relationship Colorado? 

Shaun Fisher: We're just all connected, eh? Uncle Dale and 

Speaker 4: I 

Shaun Fisher: think those They did it for the Stolen Wealth Games. Down the Gold Coast. Did a protest there and Did a big um, Ozzfisher sort of doing a reef restoration thing with um, in Moreton Bay.

And so we've[00:37:00] 

Benjamin Knight: How long's this been here? 

Shaun Fisher: These leases? I don't know if it was um,

I don't know if it's, uh, 1900s or whenever they started to market out and call them leases. But, um, you see that, so where we put these, there's sort of an old reef, oyster reef. And over time, I think, because of the over extraction of these, of the bay. You get the, uh, drills they call them, and so the ecosystem's out of whack.

So none of these, anything that tries to grow and get established, nothing grows because the, well, the, these, um, drills are smashing them. So [00:38:00] Any old reef is really struggling to continue building on it.

Benjamin Knight: What's the process of regeneration you reckon? 

Shaun Fisher: Furniture. So pretty much what we've done there. Um, I think those tripods are a bit big. We've sort of done a bit of an overkill, but I think many of those and other sort of, um, furniture that can sort of create a bit of a hiding spot, but somewhere they can just keep building off.

It's a good foundation. And with that I think you can Just slowly start to build these [00:39:00] micro ecosystems and then hopefully then over time they just But see with marine parks and all those types of things, a lot of those things dictate and hinder But what we're doing here Um It was a challenge for me to even purchase my own lease Um, but it was the only way I feel that I could get taken serious enough.

So, Yeah, there's a lot of those legislations and stuff that dictate outcomes for restoration and, um, oyster farming.

But, um, Yeah, it's just trying to navigate through those things and keep that going for these fellas. So, [00:40:00] that's um, sort of.

Watch that motor.

You sure? Should I get your brother?

We're not jumping no more. Alright, sit down now, we've got to get going. Everyone's waiting for us. It's a really awesome lease for um, because it's up against the island. It's really good for a nursery.[00:41:00] 

They had to get someone to secure it. Um, so that's still in process. So it's um, early stages of even being able to get it back into community. So, I think again, but, if you're not in this or privy to that information, you're not going to be privy to those opportunities that come up. Alright, come back. So it's just again, that unity, working together for the bigger picture stuff.

And, 

Speaker 4: where we 

Shaun Fisher: want to go, I think, Milton, I'm waiting for you so we can go please. Um. Is create traineeships, create job opportunities for these young ones, but also for our men. And, um, again, work in the bay to, to, [00:42:00] to advantage those outcomes. And to get the best outcomes of actual oyster farming. So again, having locations like that, having locations like that.

Having locations south of Dunwich where they're going to get a lot more fatter, a lot earlier. So the oysters south of Dunwich, because they're such high, um, foods that come out of the rivers. That's where those oysters will fatten a lot quicker. But up here, the cleanliness of the water, the open waters in the, this is the Rainbow Channel, best oysters ever.

You can't get any better. But they fatten a lot later in the season. So, work in the bay, um, yeah, to get the best outcomes.

Alright.[00:43:00] 

Speaker 8: Have you been out there helping Dad on the oyster leaves? Yep.

Speaker 10: And this is

Ben. All the people you can ask questions to. And Sean. 

Milton: And Uncle Phil. Hey Milton. Um, sorry? You want to talk us through what you want to do? 

Shaun Fisher: Yeah, okay. I gotta, I gotta set this pump up, so this will help us jet these um, poles in. Post. [00:44:00] And, just sorta, Yeah, just set them in. So they don't go anywhere. It's coming in.

Well, it's, this is dead low. So, Um,

Yeah, so I'll set these up, so these, this is just a fire pump, firefighter pump, and we use that to set all of our posts in, so everything out on the farm, so all those posts we did with this, um, and, yeah, it's sort of. a tough way of farming. So 

Benjamin Knight: what's, what's, where's this fitting relation to how most people do it?

Like, is this, uh, 

Shaun Fisher: this style of farming here in Moreton Bay is common. [00:45:00] So a lot of. current farmers are using bag and line systems. Um, so they'd use this to put their posts in, which I'll show you soon. I'll go over and show you what, what our bags are and what style of farming is currently used. With a lot of the commercial farmers now, um, so That sort of being said, we're, we're Today sort of putting these three different timbers, the Cypress June Pine and the um, She Oak And with uh, UQ Ben, Ben Moss and the crew and the holiday program Um, we can put these in with the kids and Sort of monitor what?

over the next few years, what grows on it, what species, [00:46:00] um, and, um, yeah, sort of target what we're trying to achieve for food and food safety for our next generation. And continue in those old ways our people have always farmed, so Yeah, that's What we're doing today, and then With that

Sort of Showing them that process from the start. So step one, this is how we catch the oysters This is how Well, yeah, get you throw that one in catch the oysters. This is how we When we come back to harvest the oysters. And the best times to sort of catch and all the rest of it as well. So just sort of studying the bay.[00:47:00] 

Studying what that

looks like. Just getting them all in tune and sync with it all. I think it's perfect age for a lot of these young ones now to start learning. And Back down there. Hey, can you take this out? As far as you can that way. And I'll slowly feed it out to 

Speaker 9: you. 

Shaun Fisher: It's alright.

Manny, here you go. It's footy training. Where's 

Speaker 4: the Bubba? 

Shaun Fisher: Where's he? He's with Mum. 

Speaker 4: Where's mom? 

Shaun Fisher: Over town. 

Speaker 4: Oh, so it's just you and the boys [00:48:00] today? 

Shaun Fisher: Just me and the boys today, yeah. Just um, Yeah, me and the boys, so. What's this coming for now? So this is gonna put the post in. We're gonna,

I've gotta prime it. So, I think the best thing is to

climb this as well. Stuff that's floating in the back there behind them posts.

They're called oyster pods, cages. And um, there's other, lot of different floating stuff. [00:49:00] Um, and it's all really, um, new stuff as well, so, a lot of trials and research going into that type of stuff. But, yeah, there's some, um, things that, um, Need to 

Benjamin Knight: So they just anchor into the ground? 

Shaun Fisher: Yeah, there's two anchors either end.

And then they're sort of joined by rope. So, with that Um Hey, do you want to hold on to that? Hold on!

Yeah, I just want to try and I'm scared! 

Speaker 4: Put in this hole. 

Shaun Fisher: So, come in.

Bring it in.[00:50:00] 

Benjamin Knight: Stand him up. Alright, next one. Stand him up. Next one.[00:51:00] 

One type of wood on each leg of the tripod.

Yeah. 

Shaun Fisher: Take that one over there to Wait up, sorry, which one's which? Yeah, we've got three here. Okay, 

Milton: so 

Shaun Fisher: What we're gonna do, we're just gonna

Sink these in. Just so they, see how they float. We don't want them floating away. So, this is the post.

So we can [00:52:00] um,

so this one here, we put them in as a shiego.

Watch out please, that's very dangerous.

Here, pull right there. This one here, this is a cypress here. Last[00:53:00] 

one,

this one's a dune pine.

Dune pine. Yeah, this one here, smooth the bark, I think. But then, watch out, watch out. Alright, let go. Don't do that.

Yeah, different. Yeah. [00:54:00] Different, uh,

weight up. So this one will catch a lot more than this one. Yeah, yeah. But 

this one's a harder timber too. So it'll last probably a lot longer. This one, I reckon, 

Milton: um, 

Shaun Fisher: Mangrove worm. So. Yeah.

Alright, we'll do the last one out here, very deep.

The new infrastructure, from, um, from us that we put in. And this is some of the old stuff from the old farmers that used to farm here. But um, [00:55:00] this lease again being sort of sheltered and only the Westleys. Similar to the, to the Northern Shack as well Jen. Um, this is what I'll use for my nursery. So, and then um,

yeah. Sort of housing all the smaller stuff and then, oh, yes.

So these oysters here I have sort of separated, um, what's that, there's [00:56:00] 12 here. So these ones,

these ones are from the hatchery. These are the ones that, that we got that day. So I'll grab some out. 

Milton: So 

Shaun Fisher: these are the baby oysters. 

Speaker 5: Um, 

Shaun Fisher: so the department of fisheries or DPI, they mob, hatch these in the hatchery up in Bribie Island. And um, I think they did them mid last year and we were able to pick these up.

Um, so a lot of us, a lot of farmers in Moreton Bay got these to trial and these are called the Sunshine Oyster, [00:57:00] so lineage G. And um, yeah, so they're all, they're all little, yeah. So we've 

Benjamin Knight: How do they move? What's the process of like So Nurse, reconditioner, 

Shaun Fisher: paramedic, partner? I guess Um Move, what do you, I mean, like, um These ones, I'll show you how small they They were when we got them, so they're Pretty Tiny.

If we go down here. Physically motivated? 

Benjamin Knight: Yeah, so

Shaun Fisher: These ones will stay in here and it's just managing the overcatch. So, as they grow, we put [00:58:00] roughly 1. 5 litres per bag. So you've got to, as they grow, you've got to manage it. These ones are wild caught ones, so these are caught from Moreton Bay. And that's the spat that's, um, grown here in the bay. So, these, um, Around, around the same time, maybe a little bit older, probably from last year's winter catch or something.

So I got them from, from Dylan, um, one of the other brothers that farm. He, yeah? Um, I was there. Did ya? Did you bring a knife? 

Milton: No. 

Shaun Fisher: So, yeah, so moving these, so you gotta move them, so, you can see all this stuff is, [00:59:00] um, these bags are only very new. Milton tellin

Yeah, these are the same, these are the um, wild caught ones. So you're just grading them as you, as you, um. Sort of sorting out. So you sort out your front runners, which are your faster growing oysters, and then you'll have your runts which don't grow as fast as the others and then Which these ones here are the runts from the hatchery.

So I'll show you how How these have sort of

Sort of stayed as runts. So they're the same age as the first ones that we had a look at. I'll show you, Jen. 

Speaker 9: These are,

Shaun Fisher: These 

Speaker 10: are [01:00:00] the babies. 

Shaun Fisher: So they're the ones that we call runts. They don't grow as fast as the, As the other ones. So they're the same age as the first ones we had a look at. Yeah. Same age, they're the ones that we picked up that day. Um, so these ones just don't grow as well. 

Milton: Are they also the sunshine?

Shaun Fisher: They're the sunshine, yeah. So again, we've been able to sort them out and sort which ones are going to be our good ones. Yeah. And which ones are our not good ones. So 

Milton: you've got to do all that manually? 

Shaun Fisher: Yeah. Unless you can get some big, um, high tech stuff. But for now, yeah, we just sorted that by hand. So

Yeah, yeah, um To be honest, I only brought these out last week. [01:01:00] Yeah, so I brought these out last week and As they grow I think I'll give them another few. Oh, they're a bit bit old a not much to eat No. Spill them, we don't have any big ones for yous to eat. 

Milton: Yeah. 

Shaun Fisher: None. I'll put them in here, look. 

Speaker 9: Where, where, where are they?

Benjamin Knight: Oh, 

Shaun Fisher: did you want that? It's gone now. 

Benjamin Knight: When's the next, like, harvest type situation? Or when's the next, um, the oysters office sort of? Yeah, 

Shaun Fisher: so for me, I gotta buy in some oysters. So if I can buy in some oysters from another farmer. And we can try and get that cash flow and that will help sort of keep that consistency of the business building.

Benjamin Knight: These 

Shaun Fisher: ones will be about three years. So from spat to, hey, jump off [01:02:00] there. He's going to break my ropes. Off the ropes, Milton, Milton, Milton, Milton. 

Speaker 9: Milton, get off! 

Shaun Fisher: Milton! We're all looking at you, son. You're on the post. So, yeah, about three years. Um, to the end product, so. Bit of work there, but. It's, um. 

Benjamin Knight: But then, after three years, you're kind of like working at Elks.

Shaun Fisher: See, with the wild caught stuff, you want to be able to not miss a catch. So every time, we'll go over here and have a look at these. Milton, if I got to speak to you again son, you're gonna be in big trouble. 

Speaker 4: Alright, 

Shaun Fisher: get off the lines. Um,[01:03:00] 

yeah, these are the floating ones. So if you just want to come have a look at these ones, these are the floating There's nothing in here, but Go

Speaker 9: get 

Shaun Fisher: that spear Milton

Why are they all flipped? Because I'm cleaning the barnacles off them so that's the idea around the floating stuff is

Ben Ben mate 

Benjamin Knight: So

Shaun Fisher: the idea around the floating stuff [01:04:00] Compared to say that stuff to make it manageable into sort of upscale and go large You have to go to this floating stuff Which Allows you to manage your over catch so your over catches your barnacles your baby spat oysters all those types of things that grow And so, here, mate.

Um, The way that these work usually is the way that they are now. But to then manage that overcut, once a month you'd flip them over for a certain amount of time. So you'd flip them for about a day. Considering weather dependent as well, so. Um, if you leave them longer you'd leave them for maybe three to four days to manage that.

If you left that length here a [01:05:00] little bit longer, so. That's the idea. If you want to go along and flip all these over boys, um,

and then How

Benjamin Knight: many of these would you have at each? There's an ideal number of these that would make it. 

Shaun Fisher: Bob? 

Benjamin Knight: Yeah. 

Shaun Fisher: I'm looking like, 400, 500 

Speaker 4: would be the ideal. 

Shaun Fisher: So these are 500 a pop. These are only a trial that we're doing but, cause these are a new make, these are still in very early stages of, like some of these are.

So [01:06:00] production hasn't been around quite long enough to fine tune it. 

Benjamin Knight: These 

Shaun Fisher: have been knocked off from a design in Canada. So another farmer that's just down the road created these. He's um, So where, where's, you got other big players in the game that have been around quite some time and they've only just brought out the product that they've been trialing in Canada or in America.

And it's a lot better make, it's a plastic, so it doesn't degrade and Yeah, so there, that's a new way of farming. Um, that we're all sort of looking at going here in Moreton Bay. So it's just, [01:07:00] technology's all very, um, new stuff. But, a lot, yeah, a lot of different ways as well, so, just trying to get at that.

What, what best suits your farm as well, so. Yeah. I can take you down here and show you what the spat catchers are. That way I can grab that spear. Um, So the idea, Um,

Around This farm again is more so the nursery, Hatchery, Um, farm for fish as oysters. And so this is where we'll be able to sort of walk from the land. This is all [01:08:00] usually dry as well. When we come out here on the low tide and then um, it's a lot easier to sort of but as we gradually grow and things like pontoons and bigger punts that are work boats and things like that.

Um, more infrastructure like that will just definitely enhance the business and we'll be able to sort of, yeah, look at

bigger opportunities, I guess, is getting these young ones involved.

And so as I, like as a young fella growing up here, you know, we'd come out, go mud crabbing and, um,

come along here and, You know, you'd see your oyster farmers out here and [01:09:00] stuff, and it was never inviting for us. There was never a place that we were sort of encouraged to go, so for me it's about encouraging these young ones, getting them involved, and giving them their spot out here on country. Like that, there, look at them, they're gonna.

Wrecked the pods. But, it's what it's about. It's trial and error. Having a go, having a crack. Seeing where, where it takes us.

So, I built that for our spat catchers. And so the idea for that is to catch all of our oysters. Catch all the babies. And um, [01:10:00] These, these spat catchers in here are,

these are from uh,

the previous farmer that I bought the farm off. So he's had his spat catchers out here.

And so what he's used here is um, some old PVC pipe.

Right, so you see here, that's your [01:11:00] baby oysters there, that's your spat, that's them there. That's how you catch them.

And so again, being in tune with that, so there's certain times of the year, you got your winter catch, you got your summer catch, and again studying the, studying the bay to get the best results. It's 

Benjamin Knight: such a simple walk, it's just a mechanism that, 

Shaun Fisher: yeah, yeah. So there's a lot of

interesting things you can learn from being out here and, yeah. I think we better get these kids out of here, eh? [01:12:00] Before it all goes,

that tide's turning pretty quick. I wonder whose bag this is?

Oh, it'll get over your head here.

Yeah, so that's oyster farming and that process from step one, just trying to catch the oysters. And then not missing a cycle, because if you miss a cycle You miss

Benjamin Knight: your harvest. Or like a bit of a philosophy, right, of like, that community can start to [01:13:00] feel as well, right? Like if you miss the next generation, you've lost another one in the box, right? 

Shaun Fisher: Yeah. It's a good one, isn't it? Oh yeah. And that's it. That's where I think, um, for a lot of us, not being in tune with who we are.

How do we be in tune with who we are? Our identity and what really grounds us as a people? And I think, yeah, this is it here. There

Benjamin Knight: are a few things that give you hope, I suppose. Because I've been cruising around, like, Kalgoorlie and Alice Springs and Palm Island. Every community's got their different challenges. Strobe Road's got something about it, which is like a, I don't know, bit of a flight, a bit of like a grounding to something, something different anyway.[01:14:00] 

Yeah. 

Shaun Fisher: Um,

what was the question? 

Benjamin Knight: Oh I know, I just feel like when Rich came here he was astounded. 

Shaun Fisher: Yeah. 

Benjamin Knight: There's some kind of energy that he got from being here. 

Shaun Fisher: Yeah. Like I don't 

Benjamin Knight: know, do you know what that is? Or do you know how to represent that? 

Shaun Fisher: I guess we just live it, hey? 

Benjamin Knight: Yeah. 

Shaun Fisher: That's, that's the biggest thing.

Like I think, just living

and adapting to Like, where we are, look at that big mullet, um, on the doorsteps of Brisbane, Brisbane City, you know, and so many distractions here, so many influences for tourism and, um, you know, for everybody else, but us. And I think, to not be given the crumbs. And to compromise [01:15:00] that is something that I'm aware of.

And not to just be content with what they're putting out on the table, you know. So again, creating our own table. And if we choose to invite them to sit there, That's on our term. So, I think again, it's just not compromising on some things, but also not being stuck in that one way of thinking. Of um, of being, I guess, trapped from,

you know, those, those influences or, or challenges or barriers or, And I think it comes back to just, Staying connected here with your mob and knowing when [01:16:00] to go and sort of where to focus your energy and put that as well, so it's definitely got its challenges, yeah, it's not easy, but yeah just very grateful to be able to see it from these young fellas lens, you know, and sort of go, yeah, I was there.

And I can remember being chased off these leases.

And you just don't have to run like we did. You just can stand there proud. A bit of ownership. 

Benjamin Knight: Even at like case studies stuff and being able to show like, my vision over the next five years and, in five years time you're, traveling the world showing people what you did or like, yeah.

Shaun Fisher: [01:17:00] Yeah, that's, that's what it's about building that model for me again, so they can strive for something so they can see it, feel it, touch it, be a part of it. And if there's anything that I can sort of take away from this whole journey, it's, it's about, yeah, just giving them that position.

And being able to do it, um, where we're fully supported from mob and, yeah, that's where we want to go. 

Benjamin Knight: That whole analogy of the table is so interesting, like, yes, I see what's happening with a new government and, like, I think they released 500 million dollars to support, like, Fixing youth crime or something, but never in [01:18:00] that one.

That outlook was like, what are you doing? 

Shaun Fisher: Thanks, boss.

Benjamin Knight: Yeah. It's confusing for me to be here and then. And eating over there and being like, there's no understanding or even follow through or want to come and understand this shit. 

Shaun Fisher: That's right. And that's for me, again, like not sitting there waiting for these followers. And again, I feel that's a way of suppressing our people with dangling the carrot always, you know.

Whereas I see a lot of these farmers, whether they're black or not, a lot of them, you know, I see, I think they could have been doing this a lot earlier for our mob. And again, to me, coming from [01:19:00] being a young fella, being out here, not being excluded, but Not being invited either. And that's what I think it's about.

That's where it's changing for us.

Alright, better get these ones in the boat. Stuff like, what,

Since we've been able to get into the commercial sector of oyster farming and look at the potentials of what that could look like for us,

there's always been talk about,

you know, uh, co [01:20:00] ops and, um,

and, uh,

our mob sort of leading those co ops.

And it was always just talk around, you know, the land, the leases are being sort of handed back to the mob, and sort of government um, returning the farms that aren't being used, which is I'd have to say I don't know the actual numbers, but I'd say a good 80 percent of the farms in the bay aren't being used.

I'd even say it could be higher.[01:21:00] 

Moira Springs, which is a fresh spring, that feeds into the bay and they're just constantly running. And [01:22:00] so that allows, that sort of contributes to a lot of the A lot of the oyster spat in

this area, so a lot of the oysters, this is a high catching area so because of,

because it being such a high catching area, this area would be ideal for um, setting up your spat catchers. And you'd have us talking to a farmer down there. [01:23:00] And they have somewhere between, you know, 8, 000 spat catchers. So, when we're looking out, catching our own wild caught spat, and then, um,

sort of, that process from the start of catching it, but, I think if you don't have that right, Well then, what,

what sort of hopes do you have in the industry, you know? So I think, um, having that as a good starting point, um, for, for farming. So this area here, elders are still in the [01:24:00] process of securing, but they've secured it, um, to a point where, you know, we're good. have some sort of hope for our children's future in the industry and sort of start to look at, well, what do these pro, projects look like?

Again, catching the spat, um, and

starting that process from the start. So,

this um, farm sort of come about from one of my mates. You can see, um, Um, rang me up and knew I was sort of in the, in the game and said, Hey, look, there's this guy. He wants to buy this lease, um, would you be willing to, um, work it for him? I said, Oh yeah. What, which lease is it? [01:25:00] And he's telling me, he goes, Oh, I said, send me some pictures.

He sent me some pictures and it was this, I said, I couldn't believe it, you know, because These guys were asking some big dollars and I just said oh look how do I get this and I racked my brain and I was trying to work out how to secure it and you know thinking about processes um but to not let it slip away as well and I had one of my Other mates, he's a farmer and um, sort of spoke to him about it and he was, he was pretty interested as well and he, he had the money, he had it all, he had it ready to go and I said nah mate, like this is, this is our opportunity to sort of, you've got to sort of sit back and wait for us, like if we can't secure this, um.

Then, you know, [01:26:00] you might be able to have a go, but until then, you can wait and, and this is a thing for a lot of our mob, is if we don't have the money or the capital to sort of secure these leases, these fellas are coming in and they're just taking it. Big sharks they are, they're sharks, they're just taking everything.

So this lease here, when we come out, I come out with my, one of my uncles, my grandfather's, my great uncle's, grandfather's brother. I've got a turtley a lot. And um,

when we come out, he was telling the yarn about when they used to shoot, shoot at them. What's the, what's 

Benjamin Knight: the steps of making this happen though? Like, what's the We've

Shaun Fisher: got to get a business plan together. 

Benjamin Knight: It's 

Shaun Fisher: a [01:27:00] community business plan. So we get that together. A lot of people don't want to invest their time into it but, you know, a lot of commercial farmers, they don't want to share that. They don't want to It's all for themselves. And so I think For me, like It's again, like we shared, it's about the next generation and not having to compete with these other people coming in and buying up all the land and taking all our opportunities away from us.

And so when they come and they come and they reap the benefits of Our land or our seas, they'll come and they'll go, and we'll always be here, and so for me it's about building that foundation for the next generation, and building it strong. And so,[01:28:00] 

that there was a big win for us and our community. And it's again, very early stages, we haven't secured it fully. So, once we're able to, you know, go to the, I think it's the ILSC, Dignitas Land and Sea Corporation. But, you know, we're not guaranteed anything as well. So, And when I had to purchase, when I purchased my leases again, it was just, nowhere near.

As much as this, because of the infrastructure, because of the location as well, and I guess what it has to sort of offer, compared to say, a bare lease like mine, so. 

Benjamin Knight: Do you have an understanding about what, like, a certain amount of capital or support would you use at the moment, or [01:29:00] would you already be?

Like if someone came to you and said they have, 

Shaun Fisher: like, a party, would you happily believe it?

The changes that it would bring to our community, would generate, yeah, massive. It'd be massive, so. Yeah, look, again, like I think if, given the right opportunities and given, the chance, and with the right people in the right positions, it would be a game changer for our community. for our people. And so, Moreton Bay, a lot of it's Koontamooka country.

[01:30:00] a lot of, um, the oyster leases in Queensland are in Moreton Bay. And so, I'd have to say a good,

yeah, a good lot of them. So, a lot of the industry comes from Moreton Bay. Up here in Queensland. And, um, it's just setting that up, so, yeah. With the understanding as well that it's always to stay within our community, so we can set that business up. And as we sort of set up as like a co op, you know, the business or the community would sort of, how I see it.

Community structure would sort of, uh, distribute the oysters. [01:31:00] And so each farmer, to sort of make it easier for them, they could feed into that. And then they just distribute all at the one outlet. And that's how I sort of see it, uh,

Panning out for us. That's 

Benjamin Knight: certainly like the foundation here, right, for people to walk into opportunities just to, on offer, if no one offers them like that. 

Shaun Fisher: Yeah, 

Benjamin Knight: yeah. It's like that's, we've got to build the, need, the capacity on the island to be like, reading, games and all that. 

Shaun Fisher: Yeah. Hatcheries. Yeah. Um, massive.

You know, and that, there we can then, a lot of the, the farmers, current farmers are buying their spat from the southern state. So they're buying that all up. [01:32:00] We could be all catching it all here. 

Benjamin Knight: Is it like, if they can sit here, they can start to look at more variable levels of the 

Shaun Fisher: ecosystem? Yeah. So you'd have, um, you know, working closely with ones like Ben on, um, research projects.

Mm. Adding species as well. So. Testing

different, um, species, trialling, um, different methods and different, um, yeah, ways. So, I don't know if it's too early to talk or share about it, but another farmer, one of the big boys here, [01:33:00] he's doing some stoffing up. We've had an opportunity to secure these leases over here. And, they're, I'll probably share it, but we'll, I don't know, we'll, we'll see what we can share with others.

But, um, so I've been offered three of these leases to buy for the, for the community. And this one's pretty controversial about the wave suppression and marine pox. in their legislations. So we're currently going through a process of a development approval, a DA, to allow for us to start trialing, um, wave suppression, which is the open waters that we're in.

And so wave suppression being, um, the way of oyster farming in, um, Moreton [01:34:00] Bay. And because it's such early We've sort of had a road farmer from the southern states come up in the last, I don't know, four or five years. And um, he's gone and he's developed this wave suppression and he sort of again come up and made contact and said, Hey, look, I think, I think this is your story.

He's doing a story with a landline and they're doing a story on the wave suppression. And he goes, I think it'd be much better had that story, I said, yeah, no, I think that's a good idea. Um, so that being said, like they want a few million for it. It'll have like, but we could potentially be the biggest oyster farmers in [01:35:00] Queensland from that opportunity.

So I believe like, there is good farmers out there that really want to see us be successful. As Kondamooka original owners of this country. And I think if we can work closely with ones like Colin Goldcoast Oysters, I think, again, it'll be a game changer. They've got the evidence, they've got the backing.

Um, you know, and I think he's put in the work to make it sort of, um, achievable for us. So I think, um, that being said, yeah, I think still early days and if we lose that opportunity or someone else comes in and takes it from us, we'll, you know, I [01:36:00] think it'd be somebody else's story. So,

he's one, um, one of the knowledge holders here, one of the brothers that's taught me how to farm and went on. Started off in West End Markets, me and my family, started off, we were selling these oysters here, these are grown out here in um, Myora, out in the reef hole, that's the Rainbow Channel there, and then out there's your, some of your cleanest waters you'll get in Moreton [01:37:00] Bay.

So when we, yeah, started selling oysters, we were selling Dylan's oysters and we just started off in, in the markets out West End and we could have really went, you know, and just fall into production, but it wasn't where I wanted to be. I wanted to be out here on country. And so to sort of get again, to be taken serious and given an opportunity.

Um, I guess network outside of community because you can get sort of stuck in a bubble here. Um, it wasn't until we started meeting people in those types of areas that we sort of go, a lot of people would come up and go, Oh, we, we own Worcester Farms Australia. I've never seen you, never seen you in my whole life.

Um. But a lot of people did. [01:38:00] And so it was then that we were able to sort of,

Um, be taken serious from the department. They come in, they took a few pictures of us and put a post up on their, uh, put a post on their, um, LinkedIn. Did you know, um, Moreton Bay has a native oyster? Talking about 

Milton: blackfellas. 

Shaun Fisher: And so we were just, again, me and my children selling oysters in the market. And that was the seed.

That was where we planted it. That was where, from that, we were able to then secure two leases by the end of that season. And from that, we were able to Yeah, it's start to practice. Oyster farming and, you know, years before that I was out here [01:39:00] working with a few of these other farmers and, um, working, um, volunteering and sort of trying to learn the art of actual oyster farming and, as you've seen earlier today when we were up at one mile, my concept was, I'm just going to take my lane, my lane.

My leases and all my, my farms and my land back and start to really practice it. But a lot of these fellows that I was volunteering with didn't really want to see that they want to see me take back my land and start building. So I wasn't able to go anywhere in that way. So I had to purchase that lease.

And when I did that, then I was able to apply for a lease. Which give me my boat motor. So I look at it like, [01:40:00] Yeah, just trying to Go forward and not stay stagnant. As a commercial operator. But first First and foremost, as, as an Aboriginal man, I think,

that's, you know, we're Aboriginal all the time, so, when these ones that were sitting in these, um, associations and stuff like that, that speak on behalf of the, the uh, commercial operators, no one's speaking for my people, you know? No one's got our people's intentions.

Or they only want you to be Aboriginal sometimes. So, we can't switch off. We just [01:41:00] gotta, it's either on or off. So when we're having these discussions, just knowing when to put those hats on, you know? And keep it on or off. But I think, again, to be able to build that momentum in the industry, but, and then to be approached by ones like this farm here, and potentially secure this one, and take that on and, you know, I think there's people's reasons why they would look.

opportunities, the harsh conditions of growing out here. Um, and you know, there's other talks of bringing in another species that would just [01:42:00] definitely be a game changer to the industry. So there's talks of the Pacific oysters that they want to bring them in and they'd start those trials down in the southern.

end of Moreton Bay. And that would allow, because that oyster grows a lot quicker than the rock oyster, than your local native oyster, your higher turnovers. So you'll be able to,

so you know, like I think, in their eyes there's a need, there'll be no need for these types of banks out here. But for us, I think, it's an opportunity to be able to even look at Um, Yeah, upscaling and full commercial sized production. So again, like this, this here is the wave suppression [01:43:00] and a lot of work's been put into this and a lot of thought from Colin and for him again to even consider us as the first buyers, I think,

just very grateful for that opportunity. What 

Milton: is it sir? 

Shaun Fisher: Uh, Gold Coast Oysters. So he's, he's been building this over the last few years. So this[01:44:00] 

is a full size commercial scale oyster farm in Moreton Bay. Probably one of the biggest growers in

Queens, it is the biggest grower in Queensland.

Wonder if he'll give us some oysters. Nah.

So what's coming up? This could potentially be House.[01:45:00] 

So the idea behind the wave suppression is, obviously, the wave suppression and slowing that chop down so, when you come in

and um,

look at all the fish.

Benjamin Knight: So what do you see when you look at that in terms of what you want to do? 

Shaun Fisher: I guess, 

sometimes. For me it's, I've got to pinch myself, [01:46:00] eh, like, I'll go to the farm that we were at today, to my farm, then I think, um, are these discussions real, you know, like, are these, uh, is this a reality for us? Because I think again like, I've heard these my whole life, these discussions happen and never have I ever been offered.

And the only thing that's stopping us is money. That's the only thing that's stopping us right now in between us owning this, even though we own the whole bay. 

But 

I think again, that's true reconciliation.

And that's the biggest oyster farmer in Queensland offering us that as an opportunity to take on. [01:47:00] And I don't think there's many other farmers that really give a shit about us when it comes to They make out like they do, but they don't give a shit

Benjamin Knight: and interesting at all. Like the flow of money. It's not money. That's almost like an investment that goes through a business that then goes into sustainability. It's investment, a whole people. That's, it's a hard thing. Fat of fucking normal. 

Shaun Fisher: Yeah. Yeah. And that's it. I think for me, like it's about. security for us as a, as a nation, as a people.

And that's what I look at when I look at this. This is our, our food banks. These are ours.

[01:48:00] And so if we were given that opportunity to take that on, that knock on effect. It would have then for my grandchildren to go, Oh, yeah, no, we, we are a part of that. We are always the farmers and

we are the people from Kondamooka and

again, to, there's one thing to sort of

be recognized as a rightful owners, but I think again, when it's Played out and

in the way of um,

again having that position taken [01:49:00] serious. We're not just talking about. A few little oyster farms. We're talking about multi million dollar businesses that are going to generate

health and well being. That's what it's about. It's about being out here on country. Being able to sustain our people. And to do it in a way that we can do that comfortably. Not having to feel like that weight's on us. That we can do it in a way where we don't have to feel like we're dragging ourselves along.

We can do it comfortably, you know? Instead of doing three trips, we do one trip in a big boat.

Stuff like that.[01:50:00] 

Instead of, you know, spending an hour sorting

a hundred dozen, you can spend an hour sorting 30, 000 dozen, you know? It's about upscale and being able to do it in a way that we can manage it. And for our mob too, you know, our mob that's coming home,

How do we facilitate that, you know? How do we facilitate our people trying to reconnect? And with the population growth as well, you know, like, it's crazy. So just making sure, again, we're secured.

Look at all these big mullets. It's[01:51:00] 

Benjamin Knight: like a big living ecosystem, right? Yeah.

Shaun Fisher: Yeah, and that's it. It would have been, yeah. So yeah, I think this is two farms in one, leases that have been joined as one.

So yeah, I think, I don't know if we're allowed to disclose that, but that's what.

And then just look at me.
What bros? Just send me your full name and spell it for me. Yep. Uh, Benjamin Moss. B N J A M I N M O S. Cool. Um, tell me a little bit about your role over on Stratty. So I'm a, uh, senior lecturer with the University of Queensland. I'm based at the Moreton Bay Research Station. Uh, where I do teaching and research.
Mainly in the marine sciences. Tell me a little bit about, um, the last few years, I guess, and the type of work and how it feels to be on the island. Yeah, so I joined UQ about two years ago now. Um, based here on the island. The first full time academic to be based here at the Moreton Bay Research Station.
Um, yeah, since I've arrived, I've, um, met up with the community, met with Elders and Um, heard from them about what their, um, main concerns are about [00:01:00] in the marine environment and looking to help, um, help solve some of those issues, particularly around oyster reef restoration, about bringing oyster reefs back, creating new habitats for animals and places, um, where we can go and get oysters, get food, uh, get fish and be out there in the natural environment.
Um, why do you think it's important for, um, the, um, the focus to come from the Elders and not just from research, I think? So it's really important that the way that we do our research
It's really important that the way that we do our research and the way that we engage with community is really led by community and by Elders. Um There's been lots of examples in the past where science has really lost its way because it hasn't been connected with community and scientists [00:02:00] have gone and done things that are not ethical and not in line with what the community expects.
So it's really important that we as scientists engage with Elders and listen and understand what the concerns of the community are, what is most important for community and what is Our role as scientists is then to help, um, create the solutions that community is looking for. To help solve those problems, to help create, uh, new jobs, new industries, whatever it is that community needs.
That's our role. We're here to serve the community. Awesome. Um, there's been recent, um, some recent support around things like justice on the island and, um, there seems to be a lot of, like opportunity to be able to, um, lead their own programs and stuff. Um, how does that trickle over, I guess, to all areas from science to wellbeing to other things?
Yeah, I've been really inspired by [00:03:00] what Elders are doing with their justice reinvestment, um, initiatives. Um, it's really good to see that it's just a holistic view of how, um, the community comes together to support everybody. And my role as part of that is, is in through research and teaching and outreach with the community, um, to support that just a little bit in that whole picture, um, based around the marine environment and that just being a small part of the whole.
And how important is it for, um, people like Sean, I guess, to, um, be part of the restoration of an industry like oysters and, um, What part does that play in the community, if that's, if they can be successful in, um, sort of like, solving, um, some of the issues with the oysters, or like, um, how does that trickle into the economy of the island and that type of stuff?
Yeah, it's really important that we get everybody working together, so it's not [00:04:00] just the university and the community, but there's also, uh, industry partners and our First Nations businesses are really important as well. So when we all work together, then we can have a better chance of solving those big issues.
So, um, for instance, things like employment, um, that just can't necessarily come from one group. So where we can work together with industry, with our first nations business partners, then we can create those opportunities for employment. Um, if we try and just do that each in our own little groups, we're not going to do as well as if we all work together.
Tell us about today. What did we do today? So today we had our Deadly Marine Science Program here at the Moreton Bay Research Station as part of, uh, Elders, uh, School Holiday Program and we run this, uh, every year. Our marine, Deadly Marine Science Days, usually once every holidays. Today, we had the kids [00:05:00] doing three different activities.
The first one was looking at the different layers of the ocean, and they created a little model ocean in containers with different layers of materials. That was pretty fun. Our second activity, we had a little bit of chemistry, looking at a bit of chromatography, a bit of how colors separate. and looking at, um, how different types of metals when you heat them up, how they give off different colors of light.
And then finally we looked at some of the animals that make their homes in some of the shellfish reefs that we're restoring here in Moreton Bay. So some really cool and different science and some really fun activities. And if we've got the kids having fun, uh, sometimes we can sneak a little bit of learning in there as well.
So yeah, it was a really great day and really great to see. And what's the importance of, um, education and knowledge, um, coming up through the generations and from young kids, um, at this stage? Look, this is really hugely important. We know, [00:06:00] um, how important education is for, um, for outcomes in our lives, for, um, whether you want to go and get a job, whether you want to start up your own business, whatever it is that you want to do in life, having a really good foundation of education is really key for that.
Um, if you don't know about something, then you might be running into a situation where you run into some harm or. Um, You don't know how to get out of it. So that's why education is super important. And so that's part of what we do as part of these, um, Deadly Marine Science Days, is we're just getting the kids having fun.
And through that, then we can sneak in some learning about some different things as well. And what's the impact of having Elders and young people in that same space together learning and, and, uh, having that process? It's hugely important to have both our Elders and our young people in the same room together learning from each other.
Our Elders are such a wealth of knowledge. Um, [00:07:00] they've been here for so long and, and gaining all the knowledge and, and experience. And, um, I myself, I'm still relatively young. I'm looking to my Elders to gain that knowledge, to gain that understanding about where I am, what's going on, including here in the marine environment as well.
So, um, Our Elders are a really key source of knowledge. And so we shouldn't just think that the science on its own is a really good source of knowledge and it's a really good way to understand the world. But it's also important to have our Elders as another source of knowledge and another way of understanding the world and bringing all that together.
And what's next for the research station and UQ's partnership here? What do you think is going to happen over the next year or five years? Um, so. We've got multiple projects going on at the moment, um, with Elders and with the community. So we're working together with our First Nations Oyster Farmers to understand, um, better ways of [00:08:00] growing oysters, um, help those businesses grow and become more profitable.
We're working with, um, with Elders looking at oyster reef restoration to bring back oyster reefs in the bay. We've lost more than 95 percent of the oyster reefs that used to be here in Moreton Bay. Um, and so we're doing everything that we can to try and bring those back because they're such key habitats for oysters, um, which are really important food source.
Um, but they're also habitat for lots of other types of animals as well. So we need to bring those back as well as looking after our other habitats as well. Other things like our sea grasses, our coral reefs. Our sand flats, our mud flats, all of these, our mangroves, all of these habitats that are really, really important in keeping our marine environments healthy, which means it keeps us healthy as well.
So cool. Um, last question is like, how do you, how do you go from, um, doing this locally [00:09:00] to then sharing it on a, um, national or a global level of like that Indigenous knowledge across Australia and across the world? Because people are part of it. Yeah. So, um, so when we're thinking about Indigenous knowledge, we, we do this at a small scale, like we're doing here on in Morton Bay on Stradbroke Island, understanding, um, the local conditions and how our local knowledges help us to inform, to look after the environment, to care for country.
And then as we learn more and more about that, then through the use of science. And we can share that knowledge with, um, the broader world. And a great example of that is, is the knowledges that have come out around, um, fire and understanding, um, burning and looking after country. So we've had those really big bushfires in the past couple of decades, um, And now we're looking more and more to understand those [00:10:00] traditional practices of burning country and looking after country and making sure that we don't have those really big fires that just go through and burn everything and destroy and kill all the animals.
So if we can avoid that by understanding the many thousands of years, tens of thousands of years of, um, knowledge that has been built up in this country by First Nations peoples. Um, and.

Speaker 2: Cool. Um, Tell us a little bit about yourself, I guess, like, um, background, identity, whatever you'd like to go with it.
Yeah. So
Alyssa Dawn Brewster: I'm a proud Tongan woman. So my father is from the Noonaka tribe over on North Stradbroke Island, which we are here today. And my mother is from Brunette Downs, um, up in Northern Territory. Um, my dad, my father's from Bundjalung, [00:01:00] sorry. And, um, my mother is from Genebrawa and Gabi
Speaker 2: Gabi. Amazing. Yeah.
Cool. Tell us a little bit about, um, your involvement so far in the Justice Reinvestment stuff, super interesting work.
Alyssa Dawn Brewster: Yeah, so, um, I jumped on around August, um, with all the team. So, you know, it's been amazing, um, being able to work within the community and helping the community as well because we know that We know what, you know, we need justice and yeah, it's just been really amazing to work alongside, especially with the Elders and, you know, being able to run school holiday programs like this for the youth, you know, it's, it's been really amazing.
Speaker 2: And tell us a little bit about, um, what went into planning the school holiday stuff and how it's been going.
Alyssa Dawn Brewster: Yeah, so Taryn does a lot of the planning. Um, and then I help out every now and then with organising, um, the buses, or like transportation, etc. Um, but yeah, we let the Elders know and we get the input from the community on what was successful, [00:02:00] um, on our last school holiday programs, and then try to include the same thing but a bit different, um, depending on like the weather, if it's summer, winter programs, and things like that.
Um, but yeah, we try to do a lot of the school holiday programs culturally based. So the Moreton Bay Research Station, um, where they learn about, you know, the marine life and our, you know, sustenance. And so yeah, it's for them to learn about culture as well as knowledge from, um, nowadays and how they, yeah, help the community as well.
Speaker 2: Um, tell us about today and a little bit about what we did today.
Alyssa Dawn Brewster: Oh, so today a lot of the students learnt, um, well about, they were just doing a bit of a Finding how many, um, marine or sea life in, um, a box of shells, which was really cool. Um, a lot of the kids just dived in and found live crabs and yugarees and, and they were able to have like the Indigenous [00:03:00] name from a lot of the shellfish that they eat over here.
Um, and they were able to find the shellfish, like oysters, that were really tiny, and they were like, Oh my god, I found it! So, it was, it was really lovely to see, um, them be so excited, and for them to, like, have that knowledge from their family, from what, you know, shellfish are called in the Indigenous culture.
To now and be able to share it with among friends and have that friendship going. So today was awesome and it was perfect because it's a hot day. We were in the aircon. So, no, it was, it was a good day. Very good day.
Speaker 2: And tell me a little bit more around like, um, what you think is important for the young kids to have things to do during the holidays and how that, um, affects, um, other parts of their lives and the island
Alyssa Dawn Brewster: as well.
So I've, I personally feel like is such an important aspect. Um, Because we're on North Stradbroke Island, it's a very remote area, there's not a lot to do, especially when it's raining and in the winter. [00:04:00] So these programs not only benefit them to give them something to do, it also helps them make friends, the communication, and getting to know their Elders as well, which is very important.
Um, and, um, It's just amazing because we have, we have people who come over from over town to jump in on our programs. You know, it's free for the kids, they can come, they can engage, they can have a feed, and they can learn. And it's such, so important because then they can go, oh, there's this and this on.
from the Elders, you know, let's make sure we go down there, you know, and it helps them to just find themselves as a person culturally and have an amazing friendship that goes on for a lifetime, which is an important aspect, I think. Amazing.
Speaker 2: And, um, just in terms of like the Elders, what's, what do you think their role is, um, in all of this?
And, um, yeah, but I think the, um, there's a huge opportunity to engage them more. Yeah. [00:05:00] How does that, work?
Yeah,
Alyssa Dawn Brewster: so we are very, very lucky to have such amazing Elders on the island here. They do so much, um, they jump on to a lot of the school holiday programs that they can because They know how important it is, but they're able to make relationships with parents and children and have that kind of security.
And they go around and pick the student, like pick the youth up. And it's that, that bonds between them, that the Elders can go to the shop and, and the young ones go, Oh, Aunty you know, and it's that trust. And I feel like that's such a really important here. And we're just so lucky. Like the Elders do so much.
They help with catering and. Transportation and help plan. a lot of these school holiday programs, so we're very lucky.
Speaker 2: Wow. Um, it's very early days, I guess, for the justice reinvestment stuff. Yeah. What's your [00:06:00] hopes and dreams, I guess, for the next little bit, um, as the program, program grows?
Alyssa Dawn Brewster: Well, more of the school holiday programs, definitely, but I feel like, you know, our team is so strong and the community is so strong.
So being able to put through like, uh, more youth programs, um, more engagement activities. But yeah, I, I have a lot of positive thoughts on the future. It's just finding the words on what we can do, but You know, having that community input to see what they want on the, like, in community and that, how, how we can deliver that.
So, I feel like, as much as I want to answer, I feel like it's more for community that they can answer and then we can deliver.
Speaker 2: So cool. It's amazing. Um, is there anything you think we didn't touch on that you'd like to talk about, or I need to add, or?

[00:00:00] 

This is Aunty Evie. She's going to share some stories with you before we make up the posies and head up to the cemetery. So I'll give it over to Aunty Evie. Okay. Thank you. 

​

Aunty Evie: Hello everyone. Children. How are yous all today? Did you enjoy going out for flowers? Great. So I just want to share with you some little stories that when I was a little girl, And my mum used to bring me out here.

We would walk from one mile, you know where one mile is? We would walk from there and we would go. All this was bush, all overgrown. But you also know that this is where our grannies used to live and grandfathers. You know [00:01:00] all that? This was their old camping grounds long before other people came. This was their camping grounds and they called it Moongalba.

And that's the name they preferred over Myoora. They didn't really want Myoora to be called this place. They always wanted Moongalba. But the time came when a lot of them died, our grannies and grandfathers, and you know, we're going up to the cemetery later. That's where a lot of our grannies are buried, up there on the top of the hill.

And one of the things my mum used to do when she was young was to ride her horse from Dunwich. All the way out here to look after her grannies because they were getting old and they needed someone to help clean up their house. So my mum used to come and look after her [00:02:00] grannies that were lived here and I always enjoyed hearing her stories too.

But when she had her own family, all of her children she used to bring out here to talk about, she really didn't talk a lot. What she showed us was how and where they lived. And I remember walking from that, that, there's a lot of other mango trees over that way. The other side of the um, caravan park.

There's other mango trees down there. And we would walk down there, looking for mangoes around Christmas time. Or just after Christmas. And it was all bush. And we would come through. And there was lots of cherry trees around. And they were big cherry trees. And I used to climb up them. And eat all the cherries.

We never brought any food out. No water, because we had the food along the way. And cherries and [00:03:00] guavas were one of them. That's all we had, and plenty of water around, so we didn't have to worry about bringing bottles of water with us. But anyway, I remember pushing my way through the bush, and I saw house stumps that were there, and it reminded me of the grannies who used to live here.

where the stumps of their house was still there. But mum said, watch out now because there might be wild pigs around. So I was a bit frightened walking through the bush. And we come this way and mum would get me to climb up the mango trees to, if she saw a mango up on the tree, she would get me to climb up and I had to get up there and shake the limb and she would be down there waiting for it to fall.

And I remember that tree there. And if I, if that tree could talk, it'd tell you that it knew me when I was a little girl. [00:04:00] I love that. And the tree next to it, there was another big one that I looked at and I couldn't find any limbs for me to climb up. So I had to leave those other trees where I couldn't climb.

But that one on the corner? And there was the biggest, ripest mango there. And I got up there and I shook, shook, shook until it fell down. And, and there was a, another strange tree that we called a sausage tree. And one day you might get someone to show you what a sausage tree looks like. You look up on the internet and they had these big long beans.

There was only one, one tree. And sometimes that bean was shaped like this. And you know what I did? I took that bean off that tree and I carried it all the way home [00:05:00] because it had a lovely shape about it. But some of the beans were real straight. But this one had a shape. And what I did when I got home It was heavy too when I carried it all the way.

But when I got home, I put a face on it. And I wrapped it up and used it as a doll. That's lovely, eh? I never had dolls like a lot of us didn't have dolls in those days. But it did have some at one time. But that's what I used, that big bean, um, what did I call it? Um, sausage tree. I used that sausage bean for my doll.

And that's, that, I'll always cherish that. Do yous remember, anyone remember what a sausage tree is?

Yeah, yes, African tree, yes, yes. Huh? Oh, you don't, [00:06:00] I

never opened it? I never opened it, so it might have had like, fleshy stuff, you know, like a fruit, like guava or something, I don't know, but um, like a pumpkin maybe.

Yeah, we never ate them. I didn't know if they were, if you could eat them or not. There's a tree. Did you put the Maybe you can pass it around.

Is there a tree there? I saw one the other day with the tree. Sausage tree. I think that's just about the comfort. [00:07:00] If you can pass, um, my mum and others would, um, go out into the swamps, especially around springtime. Like what yous did today, gather flowers. Well, around springtime, all the baronia and heather would be out in the swamps.

And in those days, they were thick. They were growing in all the swamps. And there was other flowers called fairy dreams. And at Christmas time, we had Christmas bells. They were beautiful, but I don't see any more. Has anyone seen Christmas bells? No.

Yeah. Yeah, I don't know. Yeah,

I don't know. [00:08:00] But there was a patch where we used to go to where the fairy dreams were. They were a little bit different to, um, Baronia and Heather. And I hardly see them today, which is sad. Because I don't know what's gone wrong. Aunty Patsy just said,

yes. Yeah. Yeah.

Could be. So much is happening these days.

Yeah. And children, before I finish. Oh, sorry Mary. Huh?[00:09:00] 

Which one? Yeah.

But the fires used to regenerate them. So,

yeah. Well, thanks for that. Um, before I finish off now, my mum and us used to walk out and gather the flowers and bring out big bunches of them. Brownie and Heather up here to the [00:10:00] cemetery. And I remember as a little girl, I used to rake the cemetery with the graves with my fingers. And there was fences around and mum would be leaning on the fence telling me where my grannies were up there.

And um, I enjoyed all that. It's the way we were brought up as to our traditional way of looking and taking care of our old people even when they're gone. They're gone, but they're, they're still there to look after us and we keep in touch with them all the time. And it's a lovely thing that yous are all doing here today.

Thanks to the elders for doing all that. It's lovely that they're teaching yous how to look after the old people and their graves. Because that's the way we were raised. We never forget [00:11:00] them and we are very thankful for everything they did for us. They looked after us and paved the way. So, thank you for listening and have a wonderful day today.

Oh. Thank

you. Okay. Alright, we're going to get all the flowers that we collected now and make up some little posies to take up to the cemetery when we go up there to clean it. So, we'll put the flowers down on the mats and we've got some raffia to tie them into little bunches and some scissors to cut the raffia.

So, we'll start doing that.

[00:00:00] 

Uncle Dale: Dale, why is why is programs like what we did today so important for justice? Our school holiday programs, they're important just to teach our young people about who they are and, and what that means to be First Nations children. And because our people have been so generationally subjected to injustice, systemic racism and institutional discrimination.

We need to start teaching our young people early about the importance of their self worth and self value so that we can hopefully encourage them to not encounter any institutions or systems. that caused them detrimental or physical or emotional harm. Because trauma for our people [00:01:00] is so real and it is intergenerational and we're surrounded by it in our First Nations communities and we need to move ourselves out of that state of oppression back to a free state of conscious well being.

What what does this justice program with the, the elders are leading mean to you? It means a lot. The primary focus of the initiative is on the youth and criminal justice systems. But for us, we've identified how we can't just address that, those two components of justice without addressing all aspects of justice entirely.

And this gives us an opportunity. to be able to move forward through our own self determination to find our own culturally attractive alternative initiatives that we aim [00:02:00] to reduce the numbers of our young people and to prevent them coming into encounter but also to correct the impacts of recidivism.

This, this project, I think it's the same beautiful essay around like, yeah, what, what justice means to you and the vision for the community? Well, with this original initiative of justice reinvestment modelling, we hope that after the two years of our partnership contract with the Commonwealth, that we'll be able to develop up our own alternative strategy.

Our own alternative strategy will involve our own healing centre on country. That healing centre will be a place that can also be utilised by our youth, through a range of different initiatives. That includes employment and training and higher education opportunities. [00:03:00] And at that healing centre also we need to have attached to it our own culturally facilitated rehabilitation centre.

We need to have like a halfway place for our young people that are getting out of the institutions of the justice system. And we need to train all of our own people up so that they have the professional skills and abilities to implement this initiative and facilitate it into the future as a part of our own nation rebuilding.

What what do you hope people the young people took away from today's program? Well, for starters, it's teaching them things that they don't really know about their own people and the history of ourselves. And from that, taking away understanding and knowing. But in our efforts from all of the programs we have, it's restoring their pride and the value of their [00:04:00] self worth and the importance of that for them as a part of a people.

What's it's always What does this year look like for the program and what do you hope? Oh, well, due to the limitations of time that we have with regards to the contract, it's going to be a massive year and it's going to be a year where we're, I'm sure, going to face a lot of obstacles and challenges but as we do as a people through our self determination and self resilience, we'll Endure and pursue it with the best of our ability to try and make sure that our objectives are met.

Because of how critically important it is for our young people especially. And, and how like the Elders are leading the way in Australia and doing, you know, a program like this. You're one of the first to get funding, like what does that mean for you and the Elders? [00:05:00] It's a great opportunity because we haven't had much support at all up until recently to address the issues of intergenerational trauma and the negative impacts and effects that that causes.

And for people that are living in communities like our own, we can see because of us being so surrounded by. That trauma being lived out and the dysfunction it causes. So, hopefully, we'll start to see positive changes come soon. And that's why we're focused on our young through a lot of different aspects, including education.

So that we can start now to heal the next generations of our people. Is Yeah, well, [00:06:00] I just think also like with this opportunity we're faced with now in the modelling and how we've got the federal government support, it needs to be realised that out of this effort that we're undertaking, there's going to be a lot of recommended legal reforms that need to be addressed and we hope that further governments will commit to these initiatives and provide us with the necessary funding.

That's required to implement these types of initiatives and programs. And we hope that their commitment is going to be ongoing so that we can see the actual physical, emotional changes that are needed to reverse the intergenerational trauma impacts of racism and discrimination. Thank you.

What's the next stop on the inquiry? Um, we're going to, uh,

the Dunwich Quarry. Where, yeah. What's that? Dunwich Quarry. Used to be an old dump. And they turned it into, the council turned it into a quarry where they throw all their sand and rocks and stuff like that. I need to put this on here. We'll need two for the roads. Main roads might. What we collecting there we're packing yellow day hurting.

The other thing we used to collect was a lot of boronia, but now it, I don't want hurt because of the bush fires. How is that better? And we just need another one to go across that place. They didn't come back. I'll ask Nick where she was,[00:01:00] 

where choice for. Oh, where is it? Oh, I can't even see it! How's the shell collecting going? The shell collecting today? Yeah, pretty good, but I don't, I don't think there's enough. Oh, really? No.

Because once you spread all that shell part on the graves, there's, there's like, 50 graves out there. So, I don't think we have enough. But, we can spread it around. Should be okay. I think this is where she wanted to go. Yeah, there's those little yellow daisies.

But I think you better be careful because it's known for snakes. I think we should let the adults go and pick those. They can hand them to you. [00:02:00] Don't walk into it. Don't walk into the bush. If you can pick ones on the outside, that's good. Nick, can you pass me another one? Thanks. Just needs to go across the other side.

You wanna hop out? Is she getting in that car, bus? It's a

medium rigid. Medium rigid. Bus license. Oh, yeah, no. Um, light, yeah.

Hey.

It's[00:03:00] 

a good day for it. Lovely day for it.

Where's our first stop, Aunty Maureen? Our first stop is at the Dunwich Jetty. What's down there? That's where all, most of the coral is. It builds up there, like, been, been building up there since I ever, no one anyway, along that beach. Why are we collecting coral? Um, well the coral's for the graves, actually.

For our ancestors graves, our old cemetery.

Why, um, why is coral from the graves? Um, because that's what they used on the graves. Uh, Coral [00:04:00] and shells, mainly. And, Some small flowers like daisies. Everyone used to grow daisies. White daisies, and they used to have those in the graves as well.

Oh, too fast, you are.

And have you, um, is this the first time you've done the, the script, or is it an annual thing, or is it? Um, no, not so much annual, just, just people go out and, um, clear the grave, clean them up, and usually around Easter time. Okay. To be able to

have a busload of young people doing this. Great. So they get to, um, know what, you know, went on years ago. And most of the kids, it's their ancestors that are out there.[00:05:00]

Speaker 2: What did we do today? Talk me through what we did 

Speaker 3: today. So we, this morning we went out got some flowers with the kids and then went to the graveyards at Moira. First off we went to Tarraboola and a few of the elders spoke to the kids about the practice that we were doing today and how it was done like it was a common thing that used to happen back in the old days. So they talked about that. And then we got the kids to make the little like little flower things to put on the graves. And then, yeah, after we done that, made those, we went up to the old Mora mission grave site. And all the kids, all the jarjums got to put their flowers and that down.

And then just gave it a good clean up. Yeah. And then, yeah, come back in for lunch. It got a bit emotional up there, I noticed. With, a few of them old ones, Aunty Mary and Aunty Evie and that. But yeah, I think it's something that it's good to pass down. Considering it was a common practice that our old [00:01:00] people would do.

Go to the graves, maintain them. And I think it's also important because it teaches the kids. Who their family are. Different, members of the family. Them, or the elders can say, oh, this was your, great auntie, or this is yeah, I think it's, yeah, important that we keep that traditional life.

Speaker 2: What it mean to have your young people there with you as well? 

Speaker 3: Yeah, to have my daughters there, yeah, it means a lot. I'm keen to I was showing them a few of auntie, Joanie Sunflower, like a few of her sisters and kids and that, it's great. And yeah, Keane Fulisavi when we go over to the other gravesite so that I can show my daughters a few more of, my nan and a few more of the family.

Yeah. And it, yeah, it means a lot. Yeah. 

Speaker 2: It's some people might not connect justice is what we did today but how connected is, this idea of what you guys are leading the way in Australia in this JR funding. Why is it, a ceremony or a program like today so important [00:02:00] in justice?

Speaker 3: I think I think it's important for, like when we look at justice, we don't just look at the youth and adult jail systems. Or the the jails. We look at justice as a whole. So justice as a whole for our people is practice and culture is one of the main things. Also, we're looking at things like housing all these different things, health, all that.

But one of the main priorities too is putting emphasis on the kids, on the youth. And having things like today, it's building their spirit up. They're listening to the elders speak. They're, they're seeing their family. And it's it creates like an empowerment inside them.

And I think that's very important. Because a lot of, a lot of the things that happened to our people in the past were caused a lot of trauma. And it caused a lot of hurt and a lot of sickness in our people. A lot of drugs, a lot of alcohol. [00:03:00] So I think having these things for kids to do in the holidays and having the elders on board with it it creates that, that bond.

And then it helps the kids feel accountable and feel, they feel like they're more than just, Yeah, they get a higher sense of being, I believe, yeah.

Teagan: It's over here, Tegan. Alrighty. Uh, yeah. Okay, can you say and spell your name for me? 

Uh, Tegan Burns. T E G A N B U R N S. 

Tegan, what are we doing today? 

We are collecting wildflowers and doing a grave cleanup at the Myora Cemetery and also at the Dunwich Cemetery with the kids as part of the, um, Youth Justice Social and Emotional Wellbeing Holiday Program.

What's it been like so far, about halfway through? 

Um, it's been a really beautiful day. The kids have all gotten really, um, involved and have been really busy collecting flowers. We went down to the beach and collected some shell and coral as well. Um, we've just had some stories shared from Aunty Evie about her memories of this place.

Um, and her memories of the old people of this place. So it's been really beautiful, um, to share that with the young people in the community. This is something that we used to do when we were kids, clean up the family graves. [00:01:00] Um, and it was a really special time of sharing within family groups. You know, you'd be cleaning graves and your old people would be explaining who the graves belong to and, um, telling you how you're connected.

And so I think it's really beautiful that we can continue that tradition with the young ones today. 

What's it been like seeing the elders sort of, um, you know, sharing this experience? 

Um, it's really special. I love days like this where our elders and our young people get to interact and, um, build those relationships.

The relationship and the bond that the elders have with the young kids in the community is really beautiful. And they teach and share a lot of their knowledge and stories with the young people. And I think that's really important for our young ones to hear those stories and to learn, um, about that history and the knowledge that the elders have to share.

Dodgin here, walkin around with your old people. 

Um, I think I, when I look back on it now as an [00:02:00] adult, um, I was learning and being taught things on a daily basis. Like everything that we were doing, you know, my dad would be teaching and sharing stories and knowledge and language names of different things.

And as a kid I didn't kind of realise. the importance or the significance of it, but now as an adult and as a mother myself, I look back on all of those times that at the time just seemed like day to day activities. And all of the knowledge that was passed down during those activities. And so yeah, I feel very grateful that I was able to grow up and spend my childhood on my country and be able to learn and yeah, learn from my elders.

This is so important to justice that someone For all that bridge, like, how, um, how critical is programs like today in the whole 

So, when we talk about justice as a community, we talk about justice [00:03:00] holistically, and justice is not just about contact with the criminal justice system, it's, it's health justice, it's land justice, it's about our social and emotional wellbeing and our connection to place and our connection to community, um, so days like this are so important to build that, um, connection for our young people, to our elders, to our land, to our country.

Taking them out to see these significant places, um, also giving them a sense of pride and identity and being proud of who they are and where they come from and the knowledge that's kept in these places and the connections that they have with their elders. So days like today are so important. 

Anything else you want to say?

Um, 

no, thanks.
