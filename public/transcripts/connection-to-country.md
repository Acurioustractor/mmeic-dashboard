**Alyssa Dawn Brewster:** [00:00:00] Being able to work within the community. We know we need justice. To run school holiday programs like this for the youth it's been really amazing.

It was really lovely to see them so excited, and for them to have that knowledge from their family, from what, shellfish are called in the Indigenous culture. To now and be able to share it with among friends and have that friendship going so today was awesome.

It helps them to find themselves as a person, culturally, and have an amazing friendship that goes on for a lifetime.

The y do so much catering transportation and help plan a lot of these school holiday programs so we're very lucky.
