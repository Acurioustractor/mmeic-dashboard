# Aunty Evie

**Aunty Evie:** [00:00:00] Hello everyone. Children. How are yous all today? Did you enjoy going out for flowers? Great. So I just want to share with you some little stories that when I was a little girl, and my mum used to bring me out here.

We would walk from one mile. All this was bush, all overgrown. But you also know that this is where our grannies used to live and grandfathers. This was their old camping grounds long before other people came. This was their camping grounds and they called it Moongalba.

But the time came when a lot of them died, our grannies and grandfathers, and you know, we're going up to the cemetery later. That's where a lot of our grannies are buried, up there on the top of the hill.

It's the way we were brought up as [00:01:00] to our traditional way of looking and taking care of our old people even when they're gone. They're gone, but they're, they're still there to look after us and we keep in touch with them all the time. And it's a lovely thing that yous are all doing here today.

Thanks to the Elders for doing all that. It's lovely that they're teaching yous how to look after the old people and their graves. Because that's the way we were raised. We never forget them and we are very thankful for everything they did for us. They looked after us and paved the way. So, thank you for listening and have a wonderful day today.
