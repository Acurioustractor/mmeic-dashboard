# Empowering the Next Generation: Breaking the Cycle of Injustice

## Introduction

This documentary explores how the MMEIC School Holiday Program empowers Indigenous youth by connecting them to culture, Country, and community. Through the voices of Elders, program leaders, and youth, we see how these cultural connections contribute to justice and healing for First Nations communities.

## Cultural Connection to Country and Ancestors

> "This is where our grannies used to live and grandfathers. This was their old camping grounds long before other people came. They called it Moongalba." — Aunty Evie [00:00:00]

Aunty Evie shares memories of walking through the bush as a child with her mother, explaining how the land connects present generations to their ancestors. She describes the traditional ways of caring for Elders and maintaining connections with ancestors even after they've passed.

> "It's the way we were brought up as to our traditional way of looking and taking care of our old people even when they're gone. They're gone, but they're still there to look after us and we keep in touch with them all the time." — Aunty Evie [00:01:00]

## Breaking Cycles of Injustice

Uncle Dale explains the purpose behind the school holiday programs:

> "Our school holiday programs are important just to teach our young people about who they are and what that means to be First Nations children. Because our people have been so generationally subjected to injustice, systemic racism and institutional discrimination." — Uncle Dale [00:02:00]

He emphasizes the importance of building self-worth and cultural pride in young people to help them avoid systems that might cause harm.

> "We need to start teaching our young people early about the importance of their self worth and self value so that we can hopefully encourage them to not encounter any institutions or systems that caused them detrimental or physical or emotional harm." — Uncle Dale [00:03:00]

## Holistic Justice

Teagan provides insight into the community's holistic understanding of justice:

> "When we talk about justice as a community, we talk about justice holistically, and justice is not just about contact with the criminal justice system—it's health justice, it's land justice, it's about our social and emotional wellbeing and our connection to place and our connection to community." — Teagan [00:05:00]

She explains that programs connecting youth to Elders, land, and cultural knowledge build pride, identity, and important intergenerational relationships.

## Knowledge Transmission

The documentary shows how knowledge is passed down through:
- Stories and oral traditions
- Hands-on cultural activities
- Learning on Country
- Relationships between Elders and youth

> "When I look back on it now as an adult I was learning and being taught things on a daily basis. Like everything that we were doing, my dad would be teaching and sharing stories and knowledge and language names of different things." — Teagan [00:06:00]

## Cultural Practices and Self-Determination

Shaun Fisher discusses the importance of continuing traditional practices like harvesting oysters and using native timbers:

> "I think oysters have always been a part of who we are. It's one of our main food sources and I think it's just something that you almost take for granted." — Shaun Fisher [00:07:00]

He explains how the community is reclaiming their land and traditions through self-determination:

> "Self determination, to have stability and take back what was ours. We just repossessed the land. We just took it back and started building our houses, building our foundations strong so they didn't fall down and continue on that for the next generation." — Shaun Fisher [00:07:30]

## Youth Empowerment

Alyssa Dawn Brewster highlights the positive impact of the program on youth:

> "Being able to work within the community. We know we need justice. To run school holiday programs like this for the youth it's been really amazing." — Alyssa Dawn Brewster [00:06:00]

She describes how cultural knowledge builds confidence and friendships among the participants:

> "It helps them to find themselves as a person, culturally, and have an amazing friendship that goes on for a lifetime." — Alyssa Dawn Brewster [00:06:30]
