# Youth Perspectives - Video Transcript

## Introduction

In this interview, Sarah Brown (17) shares her experience participating in the MMEIC School Holiday Program and how it has impacted her understanding of culture, identity, and connection to community.

## Finding Cultural Identity

> "Learning from my Elders gives me strength and purpose. Before coming to these programs, I felt disconnected from my culture. Now I understand it's something that's always been a part of me."

Sarah describes her journey of cultural reconnection and how it has influenced her sense of identity and belonging.

## Traditional Knowledge in Modern Context

The interview explores how young people navigate the intersection of traditional knowledge and contemporary life:

> "We're learning to walk in two worlds. Our Elders teach us traditional knowledge, but also how to apply those values and understandings to the challenges we face today."

Sarah explains how cultural teachings provide a framework for approaching issues like:
- Environmental sustainability
- Community well-being
- Digital technology use
- Educational pathways

## Intergenerational Learning

> "The best moments are when we sit with Elders and they share stories. It's different from school learning - it's about relationships, not just information."

Sarah highlights the importance of intergenerational knowledge transfer and the special relationships formed through cultural mentoring. She describes the profound impact of learning through:
- Storytelling circles
- On-Country activities
- Hands-on cultural practices
- Community gatherings

## Peer Connections

The interview also explores the significance of connecting with other young people through cultural activities:

> "Being with other young people who are also exploring their cultural identity makes a huge difference. We support each other, learn together, and sometimes teach each other what we've learned from our families."

## Future Aspirations

Sarah shares her hopes for the future and how her cultural connections influence her goals:

> "I want to study environmental science, but bring traditional knowledge into that space. Our people have been environmental scientists for thousands of years, and that wisdom needs to be recognized."

She expresses her commitment to continuing cultural practices and eventually becoming a knowledge holder who can pass traditions to future generations.

## Message to Other Young People

Sarah offers guidance to other young people who might be disconnected from culture:

> "Don't be afraid to ask questions and learn. It might feel uncomfortable at first if you've grown up away from culture, but Elders understand. They want to share with you. Just show up with respect and an open heart."

## Closing Reflections

The interview concludes with Sarah's reflections on the ongoing impact of the MMEIC School Holiday Program:

> "These programs aren't just about cultural activities for a few days. They're the beginning of a lifelong journey of learning and connection. What I've learned here will stay with me forever."
